## Ti-Client in Java [Under Construction]

NOTES: For now it works with only TiKV branch disksing/grpc instead of official release.

A Java client for [TiDB](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb)/[TiKV](https://github.com/pingcap/tikv). 
It suppose to:
+ Communicate via [gRPC](http://www.grpc.io/)
+ Talk to Placement Driver searching for a region
+ Talk to TiKV reading / writing data the format/encoding as a real TiDB.
+ Talk Coprocessor for calculation pushdown

## How to build

The following command can install dependencies for you.
```
mvn package
```

Alternatively, you can use bazel for much faster build.

Making a uber jar:
```
make uber_jar
```
run Main class:
```
make run
```

run test cases:
```
make test
```

this project is designed to hook with `pd` and `tikv` which you can find in `PingCap` github page.
For the sake of saving your and our time, we submoudle these already. The following command can download them.
```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

When you work with this project, you have to communicate with `pd` and `tikv`. There is a script taking care of this. By executing the following commands, `pd` and `tikv` can be executed on background.
```
cd scripts
make pd
make tikv
```

## How to use for now
Since it's not quite complete, a usage sample for now can be given is:
```java
	TiConfiguration conf = TiConfiguration.createDefault(ImmutableList.of("127.0.0.1:" + 2379));
        TiCluster cluster = TiCluster.getCluster(conf);
        Catalog cat = cluster.getCatalog();
        TiDBInfo db = cat.getDatabase("test");
        TiTableInfo table = cat.getTable(db, "t2");

....

        Snapshot snapshot = cluster.createSnapshot();
        Iterator<Row> it = snapshot.newSelect(table)
                .addRange(TiRange.create(0L, Long.MAX_VALUE))
                .doSelect();

        while (it.hasNext()) {
            Row r = it.next();
            long val = r.getLong(0);
        }
```
